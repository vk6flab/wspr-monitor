#wspr-monitor

This project creates a stand-alone WSPR monitoring beacon using an RTL-SDR dongle and a Raspberry Pi.

I'm in the process of migrating this project to GitHub. Until that process is complete, the instructions
are available on the VK6FLAB project page: https://projects.vk6flab.com/projects/rtl-sdr-projects/wspr-monitoring-node

The project page will walk you through the entire process of building a Raspberry Pi image, compiling the RTL-SDR
dongle software, installing the monitoring software and making it automatically launch.

You'll need:
* A Raspberry Pi (or linux computer)
* An RTL-SDR (or compatible) dongle.

Feel free to get in touch or log issues.
